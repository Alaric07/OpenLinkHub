# Lighting Configuration Architecture

## 1. Status and scope

This document defines the target architecture for LumenForge software-lighting
configuration. It covers:

- OpenRGB-imported device software lighting;
- RGB Cluster software lighting;
- migration of native RGB-capable device families away from the standalone RGB
  editor, beginning with Scimitar Pro RGB.

This is a deliberate clean break for alpha software. Compatibility with old
lighting customization data is not required. OpenRGB-imported devices and RGB
Cluster established the canonical model first. Scimitar Pro RGB, Scimitar RGB
Elite, MM800, K95 Platinum, Commander Core XT, Commander CORE, Memory, and ST100
RGB now
form the completed native migration proof set. Remaining native device families
still migrate separately and only after their hardware-specific behavior and required controls are understood; they are not
part of one broad migration milestone.

The architecture describes the intended final system. Current global RGB
editing, RGB Override, heterogeneous Static zone colors, and
base/override/effective presentation are temporary legacy structures, not
features to reproduce under new names.

Retained package-local legacy helpers can still be presentation adapters or
compatibility boundaries during this transition. They do not become canonical
desired-state authority merely because their names, templates, or stored shapes
look legacy. The migration matrix is the package-level safety inventory, and
the roadmap governs repository-wide cleanup classification.

### Native-device migration proofs

Scimitar Pro RGB established the first native package on the shared canonical
independent-device lighting runtime. Scimitar RGB Elite, MM800, K95 Platinum,
Commander Core XT, Commander CORE, Memory, and ST100 RGB are separate package proofs of the
canonical Device Lighting model while retaining their own device-specific
hardware boundaries.

Canonical state is authoritative for migrated native-device software lighting,
including:

- selected software effect;
- desired device Brightness;
- complete generic per-effect customization;
- renderer input and native hardware-frame composition;
- restart behavior after a successful persisted change;
- supported device-authored lighting modes presented outside generic
  `EffectSettings`.

The native hardware boundary remains device-owned. Device packages continue to
own USB/HID transport, packet layout, LED addressing, firmware behavior,
device-specific indicators, and device-authored modes.

Scimitar Pro keeps its existing ordinary-zone and DPI behavior. Scimitar RGB
Elite exposes its authored `mouse` mode as four ordinary zones — Front, Scroll,
Side, and Logo — while DPI remains device-owned and outside the authored-zone
editor. MM800 exposes its 15-zone authored `mousepad` mode in stable numeric
order. K95 Platinum's `keyboard` mode retains its existing per-key state and is
edited in the Keyboard workspace rather than through the generic authored-zone
editor; its keyboard protocol, presets, and lifecycle remain device-owned.

ST100 RGB is the canonical authored-zone accessory reference. Its legacy
9-zone stand geometry is normalized only for the generic authored-zone editor;
the stored device geometry, zone IDs, packet indexes, hardware semantics, and
persistence remain unchanged. The shared UI is reused rather than adding a
product-specific modern Lighting template. This does not imply that LT100, LN
Core, LN Pro, MM700, or other accessories share ST100 semantics.

K95 Platinum remains the canonical keyboard-lighting proof. Modern keyboard
non-Lighting workspace migration is complete, and mice, headsets, and SCUF
controller families may likewise use modern Devices presentation while their
native Lighting remains on the retained legacy path. This separation validates
that workspace completion is not evidence of renderer, output, or persistence
parity; every future Lighting migration still requires a family-specific audit
and cutover.

Device-authored zone state remains owned by the device profile rather than
being fabricated as generic `EffectSettings`. The shared authored-zone
presentation and mutation contract supports persistent multi-selection, clear
selection, selected-zone mutations, all-zone mutations, strict validation, and
device-owned persistence. Optional group and geometry metadata are semantic
presentation data only; devices do not expose legacy row/layout fields merely
because those fields exist in an old profile.

Controllers may own canonical state per physical child channel below one native
parent. Physical `ChannelId` provides the stable target identity; renderer-facing
legacy structures may be hydrated adapters rather than desired-state authority,
and a full Device Profile can snapshot and restore child selected effects while
generic effect customization remains canonical target/effect state. Parent
Native, OpenRGB, or Cluster ownership gates local child mutations. Topology and
configuration remain device-owned, and topology changes must not manufacture
unstable canonical identities. CCXT's generated 3-pin topology children are one
such non-canonical case. Device-specific sensor effects such as
`probe-temperature` and `liquid-temperature` remain device-owned capabilities
even where their setting controls use shared presentation.

Memory uses the same aggregate-parent pattern with physical DIMMs as stable
canonical children. Each DIMM target is keyed by physical `ChannelId` and uses
`<serial>-rgb-<ChannelId>` identity. Parent Brightness and Native/OpenRGB/Cluster
ownership remain device-wide. The device-authored `led` mode is intentionally
not fabricated as generic `EffectSettings`: its existing indexed `RGBPerLed`
palette remains device-owned and is edited through a canonical per-DIMM indexed
presentation/mutation surface that validates and persists one complete palette.
Legacy `RGBOverride` is not authoritative for those canonical DIMMs.

Aggregate native parents may expose a presentation-only Device Effect convenience
control over their existing canonical children. Uniform children report the real
shared effect; divergent children report `Mixed`. `Mixed` is never a supported,
persisted, or renderer-resolved effect. Selecting a real aggregate effect
validates it for every participating child, updates the existing child targets,
persists once, and restarts once. Memory excludes per-DIMM-only `led` from this
aggregate catalogue. Commander Core XT and Commander CORE use the same
convenience model without creating parent effect state.

Pump/AIO RGB, Cooling, and optional LCD are independent capabilities. Optional
Display presentation is outside generic Lighting state; Commander CORE exposes
it only when `HasLCD` is available.

### Device-profile presentation patterns

Full Device Profiles belong on Overview for K95 Platinum, Scimitar RGB Elite,
Commander Core XT, and Commander CORE.
They use existing device backends to save and select complete device
configurations; `default` remains the displayed profile name for all four.
For the controllers, those complete profiles also retain topology and optional
LCD values; they do not expose separate Lighting profiles.

MM800 exposes a scoped Lighting Profile only while its `mousepad` mode is
selected. Its existing `DeviceProfile` stores the custom mousepad layout and
colors, while canonical lighting state remains authoritative for selected
effect, desired Brightness, and generic effect customization. In that scoped
Lighting Profile presentation only, the stored `default` key is displayed as
Working Configuration.

OpenRGB imports expose no profile UI. Their canonical cutover records do not
make user profiles authoritative for selected effect, desired Brightness, or
generic effect customization.

When RGB Cluster or retained OpenRGB integration owns physical output, desired
local state may still be persisted while local ordinary-zone output is
suppressed. Cluster frames are not rescaled by local device Brightness.
Device-owned indicators may still use the applicable effective native
Brightness contract.

The reusable native Device Lighting mutation contract handles effect,
Brightness, Speed, supported palette settings, selected-effect Reset,
authored-zone mutations, optional indexed-color palettes, and optional aggregate
child-effect mutations without routing native devices through
`/api/openrgbimport/*`. Aggregate and indexed capabilities are opt-in; devices
that do not implement them are unaffected.

Scimitar Pro RGB, Scimitar RGB Elite, MM800, K95 Platinum, Commander Core XT,
Commander CORE, Memory, and ST100 RGB no longer retain
legacy `/rgb` lighting persistence or mutation compatibility. Their canonical
selected effect, desired Brightness, generic effect customization, authored-zone
or keyboard-owned state, and modern Devices presentation remain authoritative.
Other native families continue using the legacy path until migrated individually.

## 2. Product goals

- Lighting settings live where output ownership lives.
- Independent devices are configured on Device Lighting.
- Cluster output is configured on RGB Cluster.
- Users do not edit a global effect library.
- Users do not interact with a separate override layer.
- The renderer and presentation snapshot resolve the same settings.
- Future OpenRGB imports automatically use the same Lighting workspace.
- Adding a software effect requires one canonical description of its
  configurable inputs.
- Fixed and generated-palette effects quietly omit palette controls.
- The backend has one deterministic source of resolved effect settings.

## 3. Final ownership model

There are exactly two active software-lighting scopes.

### Independent device

The device scope owns:

- the selected effect;
- device Brightness;
- complete per-effect custom settings.

Device Lighting is the authoritative editing surface while the device owns its
output.

### RGB Cluster

The cluster scope owns:

- the selected effect;
- cluster Brightness;
- complete per-effect custom settings.

RGB Cluster is the authoritative editing surface for cluster output. Cluster
settings are ordinary cluster-owned settings, not overrides.

When a device is cluster-controlled:

- cluster lighting is authoritative;
- local device lighting controls are disabled or unavailable;
- the device's own settings remain stored but inactive;
- leaving the cluster restores the device's own resolved settings.

## 4. Hidden immutable defaults

Shipped effect defaults remain internal. `database/rgb.json` is the expected
authoritative shipped source unless implementation work proves that a smaller
source is safer. Defaults are validated while loading into an immutable
repository, and callers receive defensive copies rather than shared mutable
maps, slices, or pointers.

Defaults are neither editable nor presented in the UI. When a target has no
customization for an effect, resolution returns the hidden default. Reset
deletes the target/effect customization and resolves the hidden default again.

One target must never be able to mutate:

- another target's settings;
- cluster defaults;
- future device defaults;
- the shipped/default repository.

Tests must prove isolation at every mutable level, including Gradient stops.

## 5. Complete customization records

The replacement uses complete custom effect definitions, not sparse
field-level inheritance.

A device/effect or cluster/effect has either one complete custom record or no
custom record. On the first genuine edit, the complete current resolved effect
definition becomes that target's customization. Later edits replace fields in
the complete record. Reset deletes the record.

This gives deterministic behavior when shipped defaults change:

- uncustomized effects and reset effects use the new shipped default;
- already-customized effects remain stable until reset.

The persisted value needs a small, explicit shape capable of representing:

- Speed;
- one color;
- Start and End colors;
- Low, Middle, and High temperature points;
- a Celsius threshold for each temperature point;
- ordered Gradient stops;
- each Gradient stop's position, color, and relative intensity.

Optional variants may indicate which complete shape applies, but they must not
mean "inherit this missing field." Validation requires exactly the complete
settings variant allowed by the canonical descriptor. Gradient data should use
an ordered stop structure rather than depending on mutable map indexing. A
small schema version is appropriate for rejecting unknown future formats; it
does not imply support for migrating retired alpha data.

## 6. Canonical resolution

The central operation is conceptually:

    ResolveEffectSettings(scope, targetID, effectID)

It returns the complete target customization when present. Otherwise it
returns a defensive copy of the hidden default. The returned value is complete
and renderer-ready in either case.

Both of these consumers use that same resolved value:

- the renderer and output path;
- the UI presentation snapshot.

The HTTP server must not recreate precedence or independently inspect
persistence structures. Target packages retain lifecycle and output ownership,
while one lighting-settings package owns default lookup, target customization
storage, validation, defensive copying, and resolution.

Selected effect and Brightness remain target state. Brightness is deliberately
separate from an effect customization.

## 7. Renderer-driven controls

The selected effect and its canonical descriptor determine which
effect-specific controls exist.

### Off

Off has no effect-specific controls.

### Single-color effects

Single-color effects show one native color input and one exact editable hex
field. Current examples are:

- Static;
- Rotator;
- Visor.

### Two-color effects

Two-color effects show:

- Start;
- End.

Each role uses a native color input and exact editable hex field.

### Temperature effects

Temperature effects show:

- Low color and threshold;
- Middle color and threshold;
- High color and threshold.

Current examples are CPU Temperature and GPU Temperature. Their renderers
consume three per-color Celsius thresholds. They do not consume the generic
profile `MinTemp` and `MaxTemp` fields, so those generic fields do not belong in
this editor.

The canonical renderer contract was completed in `3f840533`. CPU Temperature
uses Low, Middle, and High thresholds of 20, 50, and 95 Celsius in the shipped
defaults; GPU Temperature uses 20, 50, and 80 Celsius. Thresholds are finite and
strictly ordered as Low < Middle < High. Exact thresholds and interpolation are
deterministic, while malformed or incomplete three-point data resolves to a
usable Low point or otherwise black. Semantic point roles are never sorted or
reassigned. The legacy two-point path and temperature Brightness behavior were
not changed.

### Gradient

Gradient shows:

- ordered Gradient stops;
- stop position;
- stop color;
- stop intensity;
- Speed when supported.

The completed renderer contract keeps stop intensity relative and separate
from owning-scope Brightness. `ed9d5016` added the descriptor-driven ordered
Gradient editor for independent OpenRGB-imported devices. The editor exposes
each resolved stop's color, normalized position, and relative intensity together
with Speed when supported, while owning device Brightness remains separate.

### Fixed and generated-palette effects

Fixed and generated-palette effects show no palette controls. They show Speed
only when the canonical descriptor says Speed is supported. Current generated
examples include:

- Aurora;
- Color Warp;
- Cyberpunk Glitch;
- Flame;
- Nebula;
- Rainbow;
- Pastel Rainbow;
- Spiral Rainbow;
- Pastel Spiral Rainbow;
- Tokyo Night;
- Water Color.

No empty palette section or explanatory "generated palette" message is shown.

## 8. Final page structure

Single-target Device Lighting and RGB Cluster use the same conceptual order:

1. Device Effect / Effect
2. Brightness
3. Speed, when supported
4. Applicable color, temperature, or Gradient controls
5. Reset selected effect to defaults, only when customized

Aggregate native Device Lighting keeps parent-wide controls above child controls:

1. Device Effect — a convenience control over existing canonical children;
2. parent Brightness;
3. Individual Effects — each child retains its own Effect selector/settings;
4. device-specific topology controls, when applicable;
5. Lighting ownership.

If aggregate children differ, Device Effect displays presentation-only `Mixed`.
The effect icon follows the displayed real effect or the dedicated Mixed icon.

The final UI removes:

- Effective stored palette;
- Stored precedence;
- Device RGB definition;
- Local OpenRGB override;
- Effective configuration;
- capability-description cards;
- override facts;
- generated-palette explanations;
- duplicated base/override/effective readouts;
- links to the standalone RGB editor.

The final UI retains:

- effect identity and icon where useful;
- exact editable hexadecimal values;
- native color inputs;
- accessible labels, keyboard behavior, and visible focus;
- semantic theme support;
- responsive layout;
- concise pending, success, and failure status;
- one nearby cluster-ownership explanation when local controls are disabled.

## 9. Brightness ownership

Brightness is scope-wide state and is separate from effect definitions.

Final behavior is:

- an independent device applies device Brightness exactly once;
- RGB Cluster applies cluster Brightness exactly once;
- individual device Brightness remains stored but inactive while the device is
  cluster-controlled;
- member device callbacks do not apply device Brightness to an already-scaled
  cluster frame;
- effect Reset never resets Brightness.

The Gradient renderer contract was completed in `fe8e2462`. Stop selection and
stop-aware color and relative-intensity interpolation occur first, after which
owning-scope Brightness scales the completed output exactly once. Maximum
owning Brightness preserves valid prior output, zero produces black, and neither
stop intensity nor owning Brightness is duplicated. Rendering also preserves
caller-owned Gradient data and resolves the circular last-to-first segment on
both sides of the cycle boundary.

The imported RGB Cluster member Brightness defect was corrected in
`267effb0`. Cluster Brightness now scales the completed aggregate output exactly
once, and OpenRGB-imported member callbacks transmit their assigned bytes
without reapplying stored local device Brightness. Independent OpenRGB output
continues to apply local device Brightness once. Cluster dispatch also copies
each member segment before concurrent callback execution so callbacks cannot
mutate the aggregate frame.

## 10. Static behavior

Static has one color per owning scope:

- one color per independent device;
- one color per RGB Cluster;
- every LED in that owning scope receives the same color.

Zones remain available for names, LED counts, topology, offsets, and output
addressing. They do not independently own Static colors. Heterogeneous
per-zone Static colors are retired, and no migration or alternate editing mode
is planned.

`ZoneColors`, `lastColor`, and `RGBOverride` are not final Static desired-state
sources. Old Static customization may be discarded during the clean break.

`af25b031` completed this ownership cutover for independent OpenRGB-imported
devices. Static now resolves one complete single-color setting through the
canonical resolver, fills the complete device frame uniformly, and applies
device Brightness exactly once. Zones remain topology and addressing metadata
only. Heterogeneous `ZoneColors`, `lastColor`, Static RGB Override precedence,
legacy profile colors, and target-local RGB files no longer determine
independent Static output. The legacy OpenRGB Static mutation path and its
obsolete template controls were retired without migration or fallback.

`22f8117c` completed the resolved Device Lighting control cutover for
independent OpenRGB-imported devices. Base/override/effective presentation was
replaced by canonical resolved control data, the workspace was reduced to
renderer-supported controls, and strict single-color editing plus selected
effect Reset were added. Reset removes only the selected effect customization,
preserves the selected effect and device Brightness, and avoids renderer
interruption when no customization exists.

`ad4b0340` corrected two issues found during manual hardware validation:
uncustomized Static now renders its editor from the resolved shipped default,
and the Reset control becomes visible immediately after the first successful
effect-specific customization rather than requiring a page refresh. Brightness
changes remain independent and do not reveal effect Reset. Focused, repeated,
race, full-repository, JavaScript, and CodeRabbit validation passed. Manual
testing confirmed Static color editing, animated Speed customization, Reset,
cluster ownership, Brightness independence, and persistence across restart.

`20e6d472` added complete Start/End editing for independent OpenRGB-imported
devices whose canonical descriptor uses a two-color palette. Presentation
resolves both colors from the same canonical settings used by rendering, and
each mutation persists one complete Start/End pair rather than sparse
role-specific overrides. Existing resolved Speed, selected effect, and device
Brightness remain unchanged.

The editor initializes from shipped defaults when uncustomized, supports exact
hexadecimal and native color inputs, and uses the existing selected-effect
Reset semantics. Cluster-owned controls remain visible but disabled without
exposing local Reset. Focused automated tests and CodeRabbit review passed.
Manual hardware testing confirmed independent Start and End changes, complete
pair persistence, Reset, Speed and Brightness preservation, cluster ownership,
and restoration across restart.

`33ea040c` added complete Low/Middle/High temperature editing for independent
OpenRGB-imported devices whose canonical descriptor uses the three-point
temperature contract. Presentation resolves all three colors and Celsius
thresholds from the same canonical settings used by rendering, and every
mutation persists one complete semantic Low/Middle/High set rather than sparse
point-specific changes.

The editor initializes from shipped resolved defaults, supports native and exact
hexadecimal color inputs plus finite Celsius thresholds, and preserves strict
Low < Middle < High ordering without sorting or reassigning semantic roles.
Generic `MinTemp` and `MaxTemp` fields remain outside the editor. Existing
selected-effect Reset semantics restore the complete shipped temperature
settings while preserving the selected effect and device Brightness.
Cluster-owned controls remain visible but disabled without local Reset.

Automated tests and CodeRabbit review passed. Manual hardware testing confirmed
the distinct CPU and GPU shipped thresholds, independent color and threshold
changes, complete persistence across restart, ordering rejection, Reset,
Brightness preservation, cluster ownership, and exclusion from non-temperature
palette editors.

`ed9d5016` added complete ordered Gradient editing for independent
OpenRGB-imported devices whose canonical descriptor uses the Gradient palette.
Presentation resolves the complete ordered stop set from the same canonical
settings used by rendering. The editor maintains one local draft containing
each stop's color, normalized position, and relative intensity, with Add and
Remove operations remaining local until one explicit complete save.

Saving validates the complete draft, stable-sorts by position while preserving
the relative order of equal-position stops, and persists one complete Gradient
customization while preserving resolved Speed, the selected effect, and device
Brightness. The server and device mutation layers require already ordered
canonical input and do not silently sort it. Existing selected-effect Reset
restores the complete shipped Gradient definition, while cluster-owned controls
remain visible but disabled without local Reset.

Manual hardware validation also exposed a seam in the historical shipped
Gradient positions: different colors at positions 0 and 1 left no interpolation
interval across the circular cycle boundary. The shipped four-stop default was
therefore corrected to evenly spaced positions 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75, all at
relative intensity 1. The existing renderer's circular last-to-first
interpolation then produced a smooth final-to-first transition without renderer
changes. Focused, repeated, race, full-repository, JavaScript, build, and
CodeRabbit validation passed.

`5a58140f` removed the temporary user-facing Palette capability readout after
the renderer-driven Static, two-color, Temperature, and Gradient editors made
the selected effect's applicable inputs self-evident. `PaletteKind` remains an
internal presentation discriminator for selecting the correct control surface;
it is no longer exposed as a user-facing capability value.

### RGB Cluster canonical lighting cutover

`fd2b3ab4` separated device and RGB Cluster resolver ownership so each scope can
resolve only its own canonical state. `af08ec39` then cut RGB Cluster lighting
persistence, rendering, restart behavior, and Dashboard presentation to that
Cluster resolver.

The Cluster now persists target state in
`database/lighting/rgb-cluster-state.json`, complete per-effect customizations in
`database/lighting/rgb-cluster-effects.json`, and ordered device layout
separately in `database/rgb-cluster-layout.json`. Fresh state resolves hidden
Rainbow at Brightness 100 without depending on legacy lighting files. Malformed
canonical state, customization, or layout fails closed; there is no migration,
dual read/write, or fallback to `database/rgb/cluster.json` or
`database/profiles/cluster.json`.

Cluster membership remains device-owned. The Cluster layout stores only ordered
member identity rather than duplicating membership, LED counts, channel IDs, or
callbacks. Rendering resolves one complete Cluster effect, builds one aggregate
frame, applies owning Cluster Brightness exactly once, and sends copied completed
segments to member controllers. OpenRGB-imported members therefore do not receive
a second Brightness scale. Uniform Static ownership, Gradient stop order and
relative intensity, and Temperature Low/Middle/High semantics are preserved.

The runtime retains one Cluster worker owner at a time. A timed-out worker keeps
ownership while one pending restart is coalesced; Stop or removal of the final
member cancels that pending restart. Scheduler lights-out changes only transient
effective Brightness and does not overwrite persisted Cluster Brightness.
Canonical `off` remains an effect selection rather than a separate `RgbOff`
authority.

Isolated runtime validation exposed one unrelated legacy startup side effect:
`systray.InitTray` called the global and Cluster `ControlDeviceRgb(false)` paths,
which rewrote a correctly loaded selected effect to Rainbow. `af08ec39` removed
those startup mutations so tray initialization no longer changes desired
lighting state.

Focused Cluster, config, lighting-settings, and server tests passed together
with race and repeated worker/concurrency tests, the full repository test suite,
`go vet` with the required CGO flag allowance, `go mod verify`, an isolated
build, and CodeRabbit review. Isolated real-hardware/runtime validation using
copied user state with native and OpenRGB-imported members confirmed canonical
`static` at Brightness 60 before shutdown, while stopped, and after restart;
copied legacy Cluster files remained byte-for-byte unchanged.

`09f14f87` added the dedicated canonical RGB Cluster lighting mutation API and
canonical presentation needed by the modern workspace. Effect selection,
Brightness, conditional Speed, single-color, two-color, Temperature, and
Gradient mutations operate directly on Cluster-owned state and complete
resolver settings rather than legacy `rgb.Profile` compatibility projections.

`f719e5f4` replaced the legacy RGB Cluster lighting page with the shared
descriptor-driven workspace used by modern Device Lighting. Cluster mutations
use dedicated serial-free endpoints, while the shared frontend preserves the
existing independent OpenRGB endpoint and payload contracts. The Cluster page
now exposes Effect, Brightness, conditional Speed, applicable color,
Temperature, and Gradient controls while keeping membership order separate.
The legacy Cluster On/Off and `LastNonOffProfile` interaction was not carried
forward; canonical `off` remains an ordinary effect selection.

`235941d0` completed Cluster-scoped effect Reset. Reset deletes only the
selected Cluster/effect customization, resolves the immutable shipped default,
preserves the selected effect and Cluster Brightness, and leaves membership,
member order, and other effect customizations unchanged. The shared Reset
frontend is target-aware: independent OpenRGB Reset retains its serial-bearing
contract while RGB Cluster Reset is serial-free. Manual runtime validation
confirmed customization, Reset, shipped-default restoration, preservation of
the selected effect and Brightness, and isolation between effect
customizations.

`0ccc2d3f` removed the remaining RGB Cluster compatibility projection and
legacy global RGB mutation surface. Cluster no longer exposes mutable
`DeviceProfile`, `rgb.RGB`, or legacy RGB profile read/mutation methods, and
legacy global RGB helpers explicitly exclude the hidden Cluster target while
continuing to serve native-device consumers. Scheduler lights-out and canonical
layout/order operations remain active Cluster responsibilities.

The system tray RGB Cluster submenu now derives its catalogue from canonical
Cluster-scoped software-effect descriptors and selects effects through
`SetLightingEffect`. The legacy `/rgb` editor remains available for targets
that still require it, but RGB Cluster no longer appears there or accepts
lighting mutations through generic legacy color/profile routes.
`rgbProfileFromSettings` remains only as a transient canonical-settings-to-
renderer adapter; it is not persisted desired state.

## 11. OpenRGB imports

OpenRGB importing remains separate from lighting customization. The import
store owns information such as:

- controller identity;
- imported serial;
- external serial;
- product, vendor, and location metadata;
- zone names;
- zone LED counts;
- disabled state;
- topology needed for addressing.

It does not own the selected effect, Brightness, colors, Speed, Gradient data,
or override state.

A newly imported device should:

1. appear in the Devices workspace;
2. initially resolve hidden defaults;
3. create target customizations only after the user changes an effect setting.

The existing OpenRGB import store may be carried into a clean installation
only while its exact schema and identity semantics remain compatible.

## 12. Clean-break policy

No compatibility code is required for old lighting state. Do not implement or
plan automatic lighting migration, dual reads, dual writes, override
conversion, zone-color conversion, global RGB-profile conversion, or a startup
migration framework.

A redesigned alpha release may instruct users to rename or remove old mutable
data and configure lighting again. The current audit classifies the following
as safe or conditionally safe backup candidates:

- `config.json`;
- `display.json`;
- `database/audio.json`;
- `database/temperatures/`;
- `database/macros/`;
- `database/key-assignments/`;
- `database/lcd/`;
- `external-sources.json` for the same host and trust policy;
- `database/openrgbimport-zones.json` only while its exact schema remains
  compatible;
- `dashboard.json` while its active settings and `DashboardLayout` placement
  schema remain compatible. Older files containing retired `devices` or
  `addDeviceToDashboard` fields remain readable because decoding ignores those
  unknown fields; normal reserialization drops them.

Expected old lighting data to discard includes:

- `database/profiles/`;
- `database/rgb/`;
- `database/led/`;
- old or experimental `database/lighting/`;
- broad all-in-one backup archives for this transition;
- `database/scheduler.json` while RGB scheduling remains mixed with unrelated
  scheduler state.

Final release documentation must revalidate this list against the completed
implementation. No automatic backup or restoration is part of this design.

## 13. Systems to retire

The final architecture removes:

- user-facing and production `RGBOverride`;
- OpenRGB override persistence and precedence;
- per-device mutable RGB copies under `database/rgb/<serial>.json`;
- the cluster mutable RGB copy under `database/rgb/cluster.json`;
- heterogeneous OpenRGB Static zone-color persistence;
- `lastColor` as desired state;
- base/override/effective snapshots and presentation;
- the standalone `/rgb` editor;
- global RGB editor mutation endpoints;
- the legacy OpenRGB Static color endpoint;
- duplicated capability lists after descriptor adoption.

Code serving native-device families may remain temporarily until those
specific families receive replacement controls. The initial OpenRGB work does
not promise immediate deletion of shared native-device infrastructure.

## 14. Native-device boundary

The standalone RGB editor now serves only native-device families that have not
yet completed canonical Device Lighting migration. OpenRGB-imported devices,
RGB Cluster, Scimitar Pro RGB, Scimitar RGB Elite, MM800, K95 Platinum, Commander
Core XT, Commander CORE, Memory, and ST100 RGB no longer depend on it for lighting
configuration. Therefore:

- OpenRGB has cut over independently;
- RGB Cluster has cut over independently;
- native families migrate one at a time;
- `/rgb` is removed only when every still-supported target it serves has
  equivalent renderer-consumed controls and Reset behavior;
- no permanent global editor remains after parity.

`eligibleForLegacyGlobalRGB()` is temporary migration infrastructure for this
coexistence period. It keeps unmigrated native families on the retained global
`/rgb` collector and mutation paths while excluding OpenRGB-imported and Cluster
devices as before. A native canonical Lighting provider is excluded only when
its `LightingSnapshot()` and runtime are usable; if the canonical runtime did not
attach and no usable snapshot exists, the native device falls back to retained
`/rgb`. Exclusion is behavioral rather than a requirement to delete every
legacy-looking package-local helper immediately: a migrated package
may retain helpers such as `GetRgbProfiles`, `GetRgbProfile`, `loadRgb`, or
`saveRgbProfile` without restoring legacy lighting authority. When every
legitimate native `/rgb` consumer has migrated and the global system is removed,
this eligibility bridge and related compatibility machinery are removed as part
of that final cleanup.

Initial OpenRGB work must not broadly redesign native hardware protocols,
packet formats, lifecycle behavior, or device-owned firmware effects.

## 15. Modern mutation principles

Future mutations require:

- exact target identity;
- the exact expected selected effect for effect-specific changes;
- descriptor and supported-catalogue validation;
- scope validation;
- lifecycle validation;
- an RGB Cluster ownership guard for local device changes;
- strict JSON decoding;
- bounded request size;
- unknown-field rejection;
- checked persistence;
- in-memory rollback on persistence failure;
- persistence before output;
- bounded first-output waiting;
- no duplicate renderer workers;
- generic browser-facing errors;
- retention of persisted desired state after an output failure.

The intended mutation categories are conceptually:

- select effect;
- set Brightness;
- set Speed;
- set descriptor-valid colors;
- set Gradient data;
- mutate validated device-authored zones when the selected native mode exposes
  authored-zone controls;
- replace a validated complete indexed palette when a device-authored mode owns
  per-LED state;
- apply one validated real effect across existing canonical children when an
  aggregate native parent exposes that convenience;
- reset customization.

Exact route names are intentionally not frozen as a permanent external API
contract in this architecture document.

## 16. Reset semantics

Reset is scoped to the selected target and selected effect. It:

- deletes only that target/effect customization;
- preserves the selected effect;
- preserves Brightness;
- resolves and reapplies the hidden default;
- restores in-memory state and produces no output if persistence fails;
- reports an output failure while retaining the persisted reset state;
- starts at most one replacement worker;
- is hidden when no customization exists.

For fixed and generated-palette effects, Reset can still remove customized
Speed or another genuine renderer-consumed setting.

## 17. Implementation sequence

1. Define and test Low/Middle/High temperature threshold semantics. Completed
   in `3f840533`.
2. Make owning-scope Brightness authoritative for Gradient while preserving
   per-stop intensity as a relative property. Completed in `fe8e2462`.
3. Correct imported RGB Cluster member double scaling in a focused commit.
   Completed in `267effb0`.
4. Add lighting settings types, an immutable default repository,
   defensive-copy validation, dedicated stores, a resolver, and path tests.
   Completed in `4f0a38a6`.
5. Add dedicated OpenRGB device-lighting persistence and atomically cut
   OpenRGB effect selection, Brightness, Speed, rendering, restart, and
   reconnect to the resolver. Completed in `c91a970c`.
6. Make OpenRGB Static uniform and remove `ZoneColors` and `lastColor` as
   desired-state sources together with the legacy OpenRGB color path. Completed
   in `af25b031`.
7. Replace OpenRGB snapshots with resolved control data, simplify Device
   Lighting, and add single-color editing and Reset. Completed in `22f8117c`,
   with manual-test corrections in `ad4b0340`.
8. Add two-color editing. Completed in `20e6d472`.
9. Add temperature color and threshold editing. Completed in `33ea040c`.
10. Add Gradient editing. Completed in `ed9d5016`. Remove the temporary
    user-facing Palette diagnostic after editor parity. Completed in `5a58140f`.
11. Cut RGB Cluster persistence and rendering to the resolver while preserving
    membership and device order separately. Resolver ownership was separated in
    `fd2b3ab4`; the Cluster cutover was completed in `af08ec39`.
12. Modernize RGB Cluster with the shared descriptor-driven controls.
    Canonical control mutations were added in `09f14f87`, the shared modern
    workspace was completed in `f719e5f4`, Cluster-scoped effect Reset was
    completed in `235941d0`, and the remaining legacy Cluster RGB/profile
    compatibility surface was removed in `0ccc2d3f`.
13. Add the reusable native Device Lighting mutation contract and make migrated
    native devices interactive in the modern workspace. Completed in
    `da1e0597` and `0aadedb2`.
14. Migrate Scimitar RGB Elite, MM800, and K95 Platinum to canonical native
    Device Lighting, preserving their device-authored `mouse`, `mousepad`, and
    `keyboard` modes. Scimitar RGB Elite and MM800 were completed across
    `2c758431`, `8b9eebe9`, `bfc4c5cd`, and `ce890f75`; K95 Platinum retains
    its keyboard protocol, per-key state, keyboard presets, RGB Cluster
    behavior, and lifecycle as device-owned concerns.
15. Add shared authored-zone presentation and mutations for validated
    device-owned modes, without treating authored colors as generic
    `EffectSettings`. Completed in `ce890f75`.
16. Delete OpenRGB override code and legacy imported-device lighting controls.
    Completed in `dc94df10`, which removed OpenRGB legacy/global RGB
    compatibility and RGB Override support, and `d607182b`, which removed the
    remaining profile-local lighting mirrors and duplicate legacy OpenRGB page
    controls. Imported devices now use canonical device lighting state,
    complete per-effect settings, the resolver, and `LightingSnapshot` for
    lighting behavior and presentation. `DeviceProfile` retains only profile
    metadata and RGB Cluster membership; membership persistence is intentionally
    left for a later redesign.
17. Migrate native target families separately. Memory completed its workspace
    foundation, canonical per-DIMM lighting, and indexed `led` editor in
    `c493d650`, `9be90f03`, and `065beb93`. Aggregate Device Effect convenience
    controls for Memory, Commander Core XT, and Commander CORE were completed in
    `aed0d672`; `Mixed` remains presentation-only and no parent effect state was
    introduced. ST100 RGB completed the authored-zone accessory proof: its
    source-backed 9-zone `stand` geometry is normalized only for shared
    presentation, while device geometry, IDs, packet indexes, semantics, and
    persistence remain device-owned.
18. Remove `/rgb` after every remaining consumer has parity.
19. Remove global mutations, target-local RGB copies, remaining override
    infrastructure, duplicate capability adapters, and obsolete CSS and
    documentation.
20. Add final clean-install, backup, and release documentation.

Every milestone must build and have focused tests. No milestone may
permanently dual-read or dual-write old and new lighting state. A legacy
subsystem may temporarily remain only for a target not yet cut over, and every
temporary subsystem needs a named deletion condition.
